| Czech National Bank ARAD data | Spark/SparkSQL | [json](https://github.com/VankatPetr/zeppelin_notebook/blob/master/2DWKVFZNJ/note.json) | [view](https://www.zepl.com/viewer/github/VankatPetr/zeppelin_notebook/blob/master/2DWKVFZNJ/note.json) It is possible to view the notebook and modify charts but you can't run it on ZEPL (i.e. getting latest data) because ZEPL doesn't support Spart 2.2 (to_date function with 2 parameters). | [Petr Vankat](https://twitter.com/VankatPetr) | ARAD is a public database, forming part of the Czech National Bank’s information service. |
